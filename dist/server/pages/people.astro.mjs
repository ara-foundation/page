Ara is my personal dream. I've been working on it quietly since I
            began learning programming in the 2010s, refining the same line of
            thought over many years.
</p> <p>
From the beginning, I was drawn to ideas that felt ahead of their
            time: AI, visual programming, Web 3.0, and decentralization. Back
            then, AI largely meant Expert Systems, Web 3.0 referred to the
            Semantic Web, and decentralization was mostly associated with
            peer-to-peer networks. That was the landscape I learned in.
</p> <p>
I noticed that these ideas struggled with adoption—not because they
            were wrong, but because they were incomplete when taken alone.
            Rather than becoming a specialist in each area, I focused on how
            they could work together as a single system.
</p> <p>
A major influence on this thinking was the book <em>Tango: The Operating System</em>, which explored what the computer of the future might look like.
            It pushed me to think beyond individual technologies and toward how
            people would actually interact with such systems.
</p> <p>
Instead of building a new operating system or breaking existing ones
            apart, I chose a simpler path: creating something compatible that
            could live on top of what already exists. Ara is my attempt to make
            that future a reality compatible with today's technology.
</p> <p>
After many iterations, and with today's technology, it finally
            became possible.
